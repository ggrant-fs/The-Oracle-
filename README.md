## Wireframes

Upload images of your wireframes to an image hosting site or add them to an assets folder in your repo and link them here with a description of each specific wireframe.

### MVP/PostMVP

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MPV and PostMVP.  Carefully decided what is placed into your MVP as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.  

#### MVP 

- Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Styled using Flexbox or Grid.
- Use Axios to make a request to an external data source and insert some of the retrieved data on to the DOM.
- Implement responsive design using at least one media query/breakpoint (i.e. desktop, tablet, mobile, etc).
- Fulfill the build requirements you have specified in your MVP.
- Deployed site to a hosting service like Github Pages.
- Make commits to GitHub every day.
- A README.md file that contains your project worksheet, a link to your live, deployed site, and any necessary installation instructions such as npm i.

#### PostMVP  
*These are examples only. Replace with your own Post-MVP features.*

- Add second API
- have user pages
- individual pages for each topic/api end point
- Login page
- OAuth

## Project Schedule

This schedule will be used to keep track of your progress throughout the week and align with our expectations.  

You are **responsible** for scheduling time with your squad to seek approval for each deliverable by the end of the corresponding day, excluding `Saturday` and `Sunday`.

|  Day | Deliverable | Status
|---|---| ---|
|Nov 9| Prompt / Wireframes / Priority Matrix / Timeframes | Incomplete
|Nov 10| Project Approval | Incomplete
|Nov 12| Core Application Structure (HTML, CSS, etc.) | Incomplete
|Nov 13| Pseudocode / actual code | Incomplete
|Nov 16| MVP | Incomplete
|Nov 17| Presentations | Incomplete

## Priority Matrix

Include a full list of features that have been prioritized based on the `Time and Importance` Matrix.  Link this image in a similar manner to your wireframes

## Timeframes

Tell us how long you anticipate spending on each area of development. Be sure to consider how many hours a day you plan to be coding and how many days you have available until presentation day. Students usally put in around 40+ hours into their project 1.

Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the game.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe. Throughout your project, keep track of your Time Invested and Actual Time and update your README regularly.

| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invested | Actual Time |
| --- | :---: |  :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Adding Form | H | 3hrs| 3.5hrs | 3.5hrs |
| Working with API | H | 3hrs| 2.5hrs | 2.5hrs |
| Total | H | 6hrs| 5hrs | 5hrs |
