- Fulfill the build requirements you have specified in your MVP.
- Deployed site to a hosting service like Github Pages.
- Make commits to GitHub every day.
- A README.md file that contains your project worksheet, a link to your live, deployed site, and any necessary installation instructions such as npm i.

## Priority Matrix

Include a full list of features that have been prioritized based on the `Time and Importance` Matrix.  Link this image in a similar manner to your wireframes

## Timeframes

Tell us how long you anticipate spending on each area of development. Be sure to consider how many hours a day you plan to be coding and how many days you have available until presentation day. Students usally put in around 40+ hours into their project 1.

Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the game.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe. Throughout your project, keep track of your Time Invested and Actual Time and update your README regularly.

| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invested | Actual Time |
| --- | :---: |  :---: | :---: | :---: |
| working on JavaScript/API | H | 4hrs per day| 24hrs max  | 24hrs |
| working HTML/css | H | 3hrs| 3hrs per day | 21hrs max | 21hrs
| Total | H | 7hrs| 7hrs | 43hrs |
